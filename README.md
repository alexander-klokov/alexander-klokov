## Hi there, I'm Alexander!

This storage mostly contains my study projects, which I'm writing to learn new things, adopt new technologies, and practice some concepts. Within my developer career, I've had different roles. I get the most pleasure when combining math concepts with software development decisions.

## My Current Projects

### [CUDA Kernel Optimization for Image Convolution](https://github.com/alexander-klokov/image-convolution)

This is a personal study project inspired by Simon Boehm's work on optimizing CUDA Matmul Kernels. My goal is to develop a basic image convolution CUDA kernel and enhance it through an iterative process of optimization techniques.

The project's primary objective is to achieve a level of performance comparable to the _nppiFilter_8u_C1R_ function from the NVIDIA Performance Primitives (NPP) library.

### [NHL Data Science Projects](https://github.com/alexander-klokov/nhl-analyst)

In this collection of data science projects, I analyze NHL statistics to naively make some predictions.
